2. **File Operations**
   - Counting files in a directory
   - Naming conventions
   - Organizing files by month and year
3. **Numpy Basics**
   - Array creation and manipulation
   - Common mathematical operations

## Features
- **File Operations**: Code examples for reading directory contents, renaming files, and organizing files by date.
- **Numpy**: Exercises focused on using `Numpy` for efficient numerical computations and array handling.

This is the repository I have created for the course Python for Data Science of the Master in Business Analytics.
At the moment, you will find the following folder:
    1. "Class 1" that contains the exercises of session 1.
    2. "Class 2" that contains the exercises of session 2.
    3. "Class 3" that contains the exercises of session 3.
Finally, you will find the requirements.txt where you will find the libraries and version of python required for the projects. At the moment a specific version of python is not required but I generally use Python V. 3.12.4
If any project require a specific library or python version, a requirements.txt documents will be included in the corresponding folder.
